# Michiel's portfolio
One this page I will provide an overview of my Analytics and Data Science related projects. I currently only have one project worth opening up to the public, but more projects will be added.



# Machine learning projects
**[Loan repayment behaviour prediction](https://github.com/Dutchmick/loan_repayment_prediction)**<br/>
Case study of a prediction model that can be used to evaluate loan repayment behaviour of currently excluded customers of formal financial services. The [Kaggle Home Credit Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) was used for this project. Traditional metrics for credit scoring were excluded to create this model (e.g. credit card repayments, previous bank loans).

### [Exploratory data analysis](https://github.com/Dutchmick/loan_repayment_prediction/blob/master/notebooks/Homecred%20-%20Exploratory%20analysis.ipynb)
Provides an overview of the available data, including visualisations and provides an understanding of the required Data Cleaning steps in preparation of the modelling.

### Basic data cleaning & modelling
Data cleaning and modelling which can quickly be deployed and used to develop a benchmark predition model
- [Data cleaning notebook](https://github.com/Dutchmick/loan_repayment_prediction/blob/master/notebooks/Homecred%20-%20Data%20cleaning%20-%20Basic.ipynb)
- [Modelling notebook](https://github.com/Dutchmick/loan_repayment_prediction/blob/master/notebooks/Homecred%20-%20ML%20modelling%20-%20Basic.ipynb)

### Advanced data cleaning & modelling
Showcase of more advanced techniques that can be applied to improve model performance. The notebook is meant to showcase some techniques, but may not necessarily apply to this project.
