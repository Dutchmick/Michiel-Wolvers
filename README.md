# Michiel's portfolio
One this page I will provide an overview of my Analytics and Data Science related projects. I currently only have one project worth opening up to the public, but more projects will be added.



# Modelling projects
**[Loan repayment behaviour prediction](https://github.com/Dutchmick/loan_repayment_prediction)**<br/>
Case study of a prediction model that can be used to evaluate loan repayment behaviour of currently excluded customers of formal financial services. The [Kaggle Home Credit Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) was used for this project. Traditional metrics for credit scoring were excluded to create this model (e.g. credit card repayments, previous bank loans).

## Versions
For this project I created 2 notebook versions:
- **Basic** - which includes data cleaning and modelling which can quickly be deployed and used to develop a benchmark predition model
- **Advanced** - which uses more advanced techniques that can be applied to improve model performance. The notebook is meant to showcase some techniques, but may not necessarily apply to this project.
