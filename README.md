# Modelling projects
- [Loan behaviour prediction](https://github.com/Dutchmick/loan_repayment_prediction)
Case study of a prediction model that can be used to evaluate loan repayment behaviour of currently excluded customers of formal financial services. The [Kaggle Home Credit Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) was used for this project. Traditional metrics for credit scoring were excluded to create this model (e.g. credit card repayment, previous bank loans).
