# Michiel's portfolio
One this page I will provide an overview of my Analytics and Data Science related projects. I currently only have one project worth opening up to the public, but more projects will be added.

# Example notebooks
- [Exploratory data analysis](https://github.com/Dutchmick/loan_repayment_prediction/blob/master/notebooks/Homecred%20-%20Exploratory%20analysis.ipynb)
- [Data cleaning](https://github.com/Dutchmick/loan_repayment_prediction/blob/master/notebooks/Homecred%20-%20Data%20cleaning.ipynb)
- [Ensemble modelling](https://github.com/Dutchmick/loan_repayment_prediction/blob/master/notebooks/Homecred%20-%20ML%20ensemble.ipynb)

# Modelling projects
**[Loan behaviour prediction](https://github.com/Dutchmick/loan_repayment_prediction)**<br/>
Case study of a prediction model that can be used to evaluate loan repayment behaviour of currently excluded customers of formal financial services. The [Kaggle Home Credit Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) was used for this project. Traditional metrics for credit scoring were excluded to create this model (e.g. credit card repayments, previous bank loans).
